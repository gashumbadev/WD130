        <p>Rwanda, the "Land of a Thousand Hills," is a small but vibrant nation in East Africa, known for its stunning landscapes, rich culture, and commitment to sustainability. Its diverse wildlife, including the iconic mountain gorillas in Volcanoes National Park, draws visitors worldwide. Since overcoming its tragic history, Rwanda has emerged as a model of economic growth and social progress, with significant strides in healthcare, education, and technology. The capital, Kigali, is one of Africa's cleanest and safest cities. Rwanda is also a leader in environmental initiatives, banning plastic bags and prioritizing eco-friendly policies for a greener future.</p>
