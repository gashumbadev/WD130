      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Founded in 2000, White Water Rafting began with a simple vision: to share the exhilarating experience of river rafting with adventurers from all walks of life. Our founder, an avid outdoor enthusiast, started the company with a handful of passionate guides and a single raft. Over the years, we have grown into one of the premier rafting companies in the region, offering a variety of trips ranging from calm family floats to adrenaline-pumping white-water adventures.

        Throughout our history, we have pioneered safety standards in the rafting industry, prioritizing our guests' well-being while providing unforgettable experiences. As we expanded our services, we established partnerships with local conservation organizations to promote sustainability and protect the beautiful landscapes we explore. Today, we proudly offer guided trips across multiple rivers, catering to individuals, families, and corporate groups. Our commitment to excellence, safety, and environmental stewardship continues to drive us as we embark on new adventures together with our guests.</p>
